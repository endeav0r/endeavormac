#summary Tool for monitoring network latency

= Introduction =

First, pinglog would not be possible without ping.py. I did not write this code. ping.py is released under the GPL2 license by Matthew Dixon Cowles

Two scripts are included.
  * *pinglog.py* Pings a server several times, averags the delay, stores it in a database, and then sleeps for a set amount of time.
  * *graph.py* Reads from the database created by pinglog.py and creates nice, colorful graphs that even your neighbor's cousin's aunt can understand.


= Requirements =

  * *Python 2.6* Not tested in python 3.x, and probably won't work out of the box
  * *Python Imaging Library* Package is _python-imaging_ in Ubuntu.
