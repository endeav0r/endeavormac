#summary Quick tutorial to mardism, a disassembler for the Military Academy RISC Computer

= Introduction =

The MARC is used at the United States Military Academy. Instead of continually converting instructions to assembly by hand, wouldn't it be great if we all just had a disassembler?

Source is available in svn. win32 binary available in downloads.

= Basic Usage =
mardism only accept instructions in binary. If you don't have a file full of binary instructions, you need to create one.

Create a text file called *instructions.txt* and place this inside:
{{{
0c92
4f00
4bfb
5328
}}}

[http://code.google.com/p/endeavormac/source/browse/trunk/mardism/ascii_hex_to_bin.py ascii_hex_to_bin.py] has been provided to quickly convert this file to binary instructions.

{{{
python ascii_hex_to_bin.py instructions.bin
}}}

Now give this file to mardism

{{{
mardism instructions.bin
}}}

This will give you:

{{{
0000:   0C92    SUBX  R1, R1, R1
0001:   4F00    SETHI R1, 0x0000
0002:   4BFB    ADDI  R1, -0x0005
0003:   5328    ADDI  R2, 0x0028
}}}

You can also specify an offset for the first instruction as such:

{{{
mardism instructions.bin 0080
}}}

Which will give you
{{{
0080:   0C92    SUBX  R1, R1, R1
0081:   4F00    SETHI R1, 0x0000
0082:   4BFB    ADDI  R1, -0x0005
0083:   5328    ADDI  R2, 0x0028
}}}

= Negative Numbers =
mardism attempts to detect negative numbers and display them as such.
